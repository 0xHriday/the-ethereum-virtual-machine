## Assembly Languages

Assembly languages are the building blocks for writing EVM contracts with varying degrees of low
level control over calldata, memory, the stack, storage, and computation.

This section briefly explains the syntax of different assembly languages around the EVM ecosystem as
well as examples of relatively simple contracts of similar functionality.

> NOTICE: Assembly languages empower developers to write highly optmized code, but not without a
> cost. These langauges are best suited for educational purposes and any production use of these
> languages must be done carefully and developers would be wise to follow standards written by those
> in the blockchain secutity community.
