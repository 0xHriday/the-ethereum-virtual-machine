# Contributing Guidelines

## Code of Conduct

This follows the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)

## File Layout

File layout follows the pattern of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

See the Rust Book's
[Summary File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/book/main/src/SUMMARY.md).

## Writing style

This section documents a few standards for writing used throughout the book.

### Chapters start with a second level heading

We use:

```
## Some Page
```

We do not use:

```
# Some Page
```

This excludes the [Title Page](./src/title-page.md). This is largely a stylistic choice.

### Always use "we" and not "I"

Pretend like you are explaining this to a friend!
